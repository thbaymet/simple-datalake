1
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,690
Almost.

2
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,603
"Almost."

3
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,530
Sir, with all due respect,
are you sure this is our best option?

4
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,656
I mean, why can't we just correct

5
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,650
- the problem?
- Because my fuckin' nephew...

6
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,410
killed a dog.

7
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,485
And he stole a car.

8
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,171
A car...

9
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,290
which currently is among our inventory.

10
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,330
So we're giving everything up for a car?

11
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,685
It's not just a car.

12
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,001
It is John Wick's car.

13
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,091
Oh.

14
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,204
Sir, why don't we just give it back?

15
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,323
He killed my nephew.

16
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,201
My brother.

17
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,089
<i>And a dozen of my men.</i>

18
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,323
Over his car.

19
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,965
And a puppy.

20
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,841
And you...
you think he will stop now?

21
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,206
<i>Hmm?</i>

22
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,003
<i>Sir, he's one man.</i>

23
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,570
Why don't we just eliminate him?

24
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,485
John Wick...

25
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,006
<i>is a man of focus...</i>

26
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,486
Commitment...

27
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,324
And sheer fuckin' will.

28
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,409
He once killed three men in a bar...

29
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,881
With a pencil. I know.
I've heard the story.

30
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,530
With a fucking pencil!

31
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,444
Who the fuck can do that?

32
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,445
Well, I can assure you

33
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,289
<i>that the stories you hear about this man,</i>

34
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,367
if nothing else, has been watered down.

35
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,080
...Mr. Wick.

36
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,646
Hey, buddy.

37
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,121
Hey.

38
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,200
Good dog.

39
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,127
<i>- What are you doing, John?
- Looking at you.</i>

40
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,360
<i>What are you doing?</i>

41
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,851
<i>I'm waiting for you.</i>

42
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,041
<i>Come here.</i>

43
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,841
Hey, boy.

44
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,004
Nice peaceful place you got here.

45
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,129
- Hey, Aurelio.
- Hey.

46
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,962
John, what the hell?
I thought you loved this oar.

47
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,246
What do you think?

48
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,800
Well, your motor's
about to fall out and...

49
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,926
the chassis' all bent up,

50
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,002
the... the driveshaft is all destroyed.

51
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,920
And I don't know if you noticed,
but you got a crack in your windshield.

52
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,247
I mean... what do I think?

53
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,171
I could fix this.

54
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,125
Thanks for finding her.

55
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,329
Not a problem, man.
I just made a few calls. No big deal.

56
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,645
Let me know when it's fixed.

57
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,282
All right. It'll be ready Christmas...

58
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,725
2030.

59
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,841
<i>Ciao,</i> John.

60
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,561
Santino.

61
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,686
<i>Café?</i>

62
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,920
<i>Grazie.</i>

63
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,287
Good to see you.

64
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,611
Good to see you.

65
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,001
I was sorry to hear about your wife, John.

66
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,611
Thank you.

67
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,561
Hi.

68
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,251
And the dog,
does he have a name?

69
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,521
No.

70
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,441
Listen, John... with all sincerity...

71
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,851
I don't want to be here.

72
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,604
Please, don't.

73
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,523
I'm asking you not to do this.

74
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,681
I'm sorry.

75
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:25,362
No one gets out and comes back
without repercussions.

76
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,051
I do this with a heavy heart, John.

77
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,127
But remember, if not for what I did

78
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,283
on the night of your impossible task,

79
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,371
you wouldn't be here right now, like this.

80
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,364
This is because of me.

81
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,965
This, in part, is mine.

82
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,122
Take it back.

83
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,480
- "Take it back"?
- Take it back.

84
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,164
A marker is no small thing, John.

85
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,561
For a man to grant a marker to another,

86
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,166
is to bind a soul to a blood oath.

87
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,169
Find someone else.

88
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,365
Listen to me.

89
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,851
What is this? Hmm?

90
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,320
Do you remember? This is your blood.

91
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,364
You came to me. I helped you.

92
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,211
If you don't do this,

93
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,567
you know the consequences.

94
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,648
I'm not that guy anymore.

95
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,128
You are always that guy, John.

96
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,285
I can't help you.

97
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,931
I'm sorry.

98
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,600
Yes. You're right.

99
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,761
You can't.

100
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,209
But he can.

101
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,930
I'll see you soon, John.

102
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,566
You have a beautiful home, John.

103
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,126
<i>Buenasera.</i>

104
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,528
Well, good evenin', John.

105
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,806
Hey, Jimmy.

106
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,491
Gas leak?

107
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,090
Yeah, gas leak.

108
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,330
You workin' again?

109
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,645
I'll see you, Jimmy.

110
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,729
Come on, boy.

111
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,525
'Night, John.

112
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,245
Oh, shit.

113
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,803
I'd like to see the manager.

114
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,611
How good to see you again so soon,
Mr. Wick.

115
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,886
Shall I announce you?

116
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,245
Yes, please.

117
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,725
Stay.

118
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,086
Mr. Wick is on his way to see you, sir.

119
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,640
Impeccable.

120
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,808
Put these into circulation.

121
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,846
Where is he?

122
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,609
Thank you, my friend.

123
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,762
Beautiful work. Beautiful.

124
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,690
What are you doing, Jonathan?

125
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,287
He burned my house down.

126
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,569
You rejected his marker.
You're lucky he stopped there.

127
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,096
What the hell were you thinking,

128
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,203
giving a marker to a man
like Santino D'Antonio?

129
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,851
It was the only way I could get out.

130
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,844
Oh. You call this "out"?

131
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,967
What did you think was gonna happen?
Huh?

132
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,849
What did you expect? Huh?

133
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,561
Did you really think this day
was never going to come'? Hmm?

134
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,690
What does he want you to do?

135
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,171
I didn't ask.

136
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,366
I just said no.

137
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,086
Two rules that cannot be broken, Jonathan.

138
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,085
No blood on Continental grounds,
and every marker must be honored.

139
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,847
Now while my judgment comes
in the form of <i>excommunicado,</i>

140
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,729
the High Table

141
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,963
demand a more severe outcome
if their traditions are refused.

142
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,204
I have no choice?

143
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,443
You dishonor the marker, you die.

144
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,648
You kill the holder of the marker,
you die.

145
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,882
You run, you die.

146
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,528
This is what you agreed to, Jonathan.

147
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,204
Do what the man asks.

148
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,806
Be free.

149
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,046
Then, if you want to go after him,
burn his house down, be my guest.

150
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,451
But until then...

151
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,361
Rules.

152
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,364
Exactly. Rules.

153
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,721
Without them, we'd live with the animals.

154
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,605
Do you board?

155
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,929
I'm sorry to say, sir,
but this facility does not.

156
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,369
I, however, would be willing to accept
the responsibility, should you wish.

157
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,411
Appreciate that.

158
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,209
Does he have a name, sir?

159
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,281
No.

160
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,522
Good dog.

161
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,324
Stay.

162
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,404
This was my father's collection.

163
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,207
I see little more
than just paint on canvas, of course.

164
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,488
But I do find myself here.

165
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,725
Please.

166
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,051
I didn't want to do this, John.

167
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,567
Had you stayed retired,
I would have respected it.

168
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,761
Look at you.

169
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,127
You're thinkin' about it, aren't you?

170
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,882
You're counting exits... guards...

171
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,563
Could you get to me in time?

172
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,689
How would you do it, I wonder?

173
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,921
That woman's pen?

174
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,441
His cane?

175
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,926
Maybe his glasses?

176
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,610
My hands.

177
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,008
Ah. How exciting.

178
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,729
Yet you know you cannot, can you?

179
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,806
I told you I needed that guy,

180
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,201
the way you are looking at me right now.

181
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,800
I needed the Boogeyman.

182
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,370
I needed John Wick.

183
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,364
Just... tell me what you want.

184
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,246
I want you to kill my sister.

185
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,605
Why?

186
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,008
There are 12 seats at the High Table.

187
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,251
Camorra, Mafia, and 'Ndrangheta.

188
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,162
The Chinese, the Russian.

189
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,528
When my father died...

190
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,248
he willed his seat to her.

191
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,844
She represents Camorra now.

192
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,287
And I can't help but wonder...

193
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,206
what I might accomplish in her stead.

194
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:51,524
You want me to kill... Gianna D'Antonio?

195
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,446
I could never do it.

196
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,124
She is my blood.

197
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,281
I still love her.

198
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,850
It can't be done.

199
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,481
She's in Rome for her coronation.

200
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,008
- You will take the catacombs in...
- It doesn't matter where she is.

201
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:16,246
That's why I need the ghost,
<i>lo spettro,</i> John Wick.

202
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,049
That's why I need you.

203
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,400
Do this for me,

204
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,323
and your marker is honored.

205
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,330
What say you?

206
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,963
Never one to waste words.

207
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,000
Fifty-nine, zero, 3.5.

208
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,571
Jonathan!

209
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,325
Julius.

210
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,289
<i>- Ciao.</i>
- Nice to see you.

211
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,289
I fail to recall the last time
you were in Rome.

212
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,840
And here I'd heard

213
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,080
you had retired.

214
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,846
I had.

215
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,607
Then humor me with, uh...
but one question.

216
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,841
No.

217
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,486
All right, then.

218
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,049
One of our finest rooms.

219
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,806
<i>Grazie.</i>

220
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,570
Enjoy your stay.

221
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,081
Mr. Wick.

222
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,130
Is the sommelier in?

223
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,089
I have never known him not to be.

224
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,810
Good afternoon, Mr. Wick.

225
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,686
It's been a long time.

226
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,330
I'd like a tasting.

227
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,404
I am quite excited
to show you something.

228
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,841
First...

229
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,247
<i>Buongiorno, Signor</i> Wick.

230
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,321
<i>Ciao,</i> Angelo.

231
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,845
Welcome back to Rome.

232
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,761
I am.

233
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,923
I know of your past fondness
for the German varietals,

234
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,204
but I can wholeheartedly endorse
the new breed of Austrians.

235
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,931
Glock .34 and .26.

236
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,731
This is the original map
of the D'Antonio estate.

237
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,280
Here, you have all the ancient ruins.

238
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,811
Tell me, Mr. Wick,
is this a formal event or a social affair?

239
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,771
- Social.
- And is this for day or evening?

240
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,081
I need one for day and one for night.

241
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,400
Recontoured grips.

242
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,483
Flared magwell for easier reloads.

243
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,961
And I know you'll appreciate
the custom porting.

244
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,445
What's next?

245
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,161
I need something robust. Precise.

246
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,084
"Robust. Precise."

247
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:10,764
This is the map of the temple
and catacombs underneath.

248
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,569
- In what style?
- Italian.

249
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,250
- How many buttons?
- Two.

250
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,004
- Trousers?
- Tapered.

251
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,286
How about the lining?

252
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,964
Tactical.

253
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,126
AR-15, 11.5-inch.

254
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,124
Compensated
with an ion-bonded bolt carrier.

255
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,170
Trijicon accupoint
with one-six magnification.

256
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,365
And this is the modern blueprint.

257
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,762
There are one, two, three gates.

258
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,330
Silicon carbide discs.
Ceramic matrices.

259
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,050
Accompanying laminates.

260
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,884
Cutting-edge body armor.

261
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,646
We just sew it between the fabric
and the lining.

262
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,411
Zero penetration. However...

263
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,205
quite painful, I'm afraid.

264
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,648
Could you recommend anything
for the end of the night?

265
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,848
Something big, bold.

266
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,322
May I suggest the Benelli M4?

267
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,928
Custom bolt carrier release
and charging handle.

268
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,208
Textured grips,
should your hands get... wet.

269
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,163
An Italian classic.

270
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,287
Dessert?

271
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,488
Dessert.

272
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,280
The finest cutlery. All freshly stoned.

273
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,291
Well done.

274
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,362
- Could you do a rush order?
- I sure can.

275
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,249
Where would you like to have it sent?

276
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,367
The hotel.

277
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,160
Shall I have everything sent to your room?

278
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,367
- Yes. Thank you.
- Excellent.

279
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,166
Mr. Wick?

280
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,689
Do enjoy your party.

281
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,281
Good evening.

282
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,164
Are you enjoying the party?

283
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,010
Mr. Akoni.

284
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,402
Are you enjoying the festivities?

285
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,450
Please. Sit.

286
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,569
Ms. D'Antonio,

287
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,847
you can't just take
what is rightfully mine...

288
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,126
Nothing was taken.

289
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,727
Those among your own
came to us with these territories.

290
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,370
A knife was pressed to their throats.

291
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,361
Semantics.

292
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,441
Besides...

293
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,762
That blade you speak of was meant
for their children.

294
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,447
They were only meant to watch.

295
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,246
What is yours is now ours, Mr. Akoni.

296
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,481
Now go.

297
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,011
Enjoy the party.

298
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,045
Have some fun.

299
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,805
<i>Sì, signora.</i>

300
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,000
John.

301
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,081
Gianna.

302
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:58,685
There was a time not so long ago
in which I considered us as friends.

303
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,731
I still do.

304
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,686
Yet here you are.

305
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,002
What brought you back, John?

306
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,851
A marker.

307
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,001
Held by?

308
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,885
Your brother.

309
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,040
Tell me, John.

310
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,565
This marker...

311
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,605
Is it how you got out?

312
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,521
And what was her name,

313
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,171
this woman whose life has ended my own?

314
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,046
Helen.

315
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,241
"Helen."

316
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,925
This Helen...

317
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,923
was she worth the price
that you now seek to pay?

318
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,291
Now...

319
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,286
let me tell you what happens when I die.

320
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,443
Santino will lay claim
to my seat at the Table.

321
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,564
He will take New York.

322
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,969
And you... will have been the one
who gifted it to him.

323
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,841
What would your Helen
think about that, John?

324
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,561
What would your Helen think about you?

325
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,686
Hmm?

326
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,166
Why?

327
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,130
Because...

328
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,443
I lived my life my way.

329
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,162
And I'll die my way.

330
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,965
Do you fear damnation, John?

331
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,161
Yes.

332
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,200
You know,

333
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,727
I always thought I could escape it.

334
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,728
That I'd see it coming.

335
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,288
That I'd see you.

336
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,161
John?

337
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,211
Cassian.

338
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,761
You working?

339
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,089
Yeah.

340
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,161
You?

341
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,761
Yeah.

342
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,361
Good night?

343
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,451
Afraid so.

344
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,210
I'm sorry to hear that.

345
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,611
Loose ends?

346
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,491
Yeah...

347
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,600
You're not havin' a good night,
are you, John?

348
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,401
Gentlemen!

349
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,046
Gentlemen!

350
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,044
Do I need to remind you

351
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,770
that there will be no business

352
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,411
conducted on the Continental grounds?

353
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,927
No, <i>signore.</i>

354
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,366
No, sir.

355
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,161
<i>Bene.</i>

356
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:27,610
Now, may I suggest a visit to the bar,

357
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,170
so you can calm yourselves.

358
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,170
Gin, wasn't it?

359
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,361
Yes.

360
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,724
Bourbon, right?

361
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,241
Yeah.

362
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,405
I had a marker.

363
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,601
Whose?

364
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,210
Her brother.

365
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,521
I see.

366
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,924
You had no choice.

367
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,007
He wants her seat at the Table.

368
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,410
He will get it now.

369
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,606
Yeah.

370
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,401
Yeah.

371
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,445
So you're free.

372
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,441
Am I?

373
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,007
No.

374
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,371
Not at all.

375
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:11,129
You killed my ward.
Someone I was close to.

376
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,965
An eye for an eye, John.

377
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,045
You know how it goes.

378
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,487
Yeah.

379
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,569
I'll make it quick.

380
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,210
I promise.

381
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,844
I appreciate that.

382
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,082
I'll try and do the same.

383
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,051
This round's on me.

384
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,481
Consider it a professional courtesy.

385
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,761
No. Thanks.

386
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,562
<i>Hello, John.</i>

387
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,927
<i>I understand if you're upset.</i>

388
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,731
<i>And I know it might feel personal.</i>

389
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,087
<i>But what kind of man would I be</i>

390
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,601
<i>if I didn't avenge my sister's murder?</i>

391
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,001
John?

392
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,287
Could you let management know
I'll be checking out in the morning.

393
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:50,331
Operator. How may I direct your call?

394
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,687
- Accounts payable.
<i>- One moment, please.</i>

395
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,536
<i>Accounts payable.</i>

396
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:07,721
How may I help you?

397
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,176
<i>I'd like to open an account.</i>

398
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,601
- Name on the account?
- John Wick.

399
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,330
<i>Verification?</i>

400
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,243
<i>9305-05.</i>

401
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,371
<i>State of contract?</i>

402
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,250
- Open.
<i>- Denomination?</i>

403
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,001
Seven million.

404
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,208
Processing. Please hold.

405
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,250
- I appreciate the service.
- My pleasure.

406
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,561
You will find safe passage below.

407
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,369
Transportation is waiting for you.

408
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,608
May you have a safe journey, Mr. Wick.

409
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,041
Order confirmed.

410
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,166
- What is this?
- He completed the task.

411
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,242
The marker is over.

412
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,241
Mark it.

413
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,086
If Mr. Wick isn't dead already,

414
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,491
he soon will be.

415
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,731
Will you mark it, sir?

416
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,807
You have no idea what's coming, do you?

417
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,163
I have everyone in New York
looking for him.

418
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,561
I doubt we will see him again.

419
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,765
Do you now?

420
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,411
You stabbed the devil in the back

421
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,723
and forced him back
into the life that he had just left.

422
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,451
You incinerated the priest's temple.

423
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,721
Burned it to the ground.

424
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,768
Now he's free of the marker,
what do you think he'll do?

425
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,051
<i>He had a glimpse of the other side</i>

426
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,690
<i>and he embraced it.</i>

427
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,649
<i>But you,</i> Signor <i>D'Antonio...</i>

428
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,046
took it away from him.

429
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,525
He was already back.

430
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,206
Oh, he came back for love, not for you.

431
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,760
He owed me. I had every right.

432
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,764
And now he's coming again.

433
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,411
<i>He did tell you not to do this.</i>

434
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,086
He did warn you.

435
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,130
<i>Addio, Santino.</i>

436
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,850
<i>Please notify MTA
personnel of any suspicious activity.</i>

437
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,729
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

438
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,282
<i>The Broad Street bound C train
is now arriving.</i>

439
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,205
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

440
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:31,648
<i>The Broad Street bound C train
is now arriving.</i>

441
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,367
<i>Next stop, Canal Street.</i>

442
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,530
<i>This is Canal Street.</i>

443
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,401
<i>This is the Broad Street bound C train.</i>

444
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,801
<i>Next stop is Rector Street.</i>

445
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,962
<i>This is Rector Street.</i>

446
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,850
<i>This is the Broad Street bound C train.</i>

447
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,207
<i>The next stop is Broad Street.</i>

448
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,727
<i>This is Broad Street.</i>

449
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,485
<i>This is the last stop
on the southbound C train.</i>

450
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,767
The blade is in your aorta.

451
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,047
You pull it out, you will bleed,
and you will die.

452
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,240
<i>This is the end of the line.</i>

453
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,327
Consider this a professional courtesy.

454
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,323
<i>This is Broad Street.</i>

455
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,529
<i>This is the last stop
on the southbound C train.</i>

456
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,329
<i>This is the end of the line.</i>

457
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:26,481
We see things,
we see things.

458
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,848
The things you see are nightmares, man.

459
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,002
Like this one time...

460
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,845
Take me to him.

461
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:42,011
Tell him it's John Wick.

462
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,050
You know, they just...
they put it in everything!

463
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,361
Hey, man. You got a quarter?

464
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,008
As I live and breathe!

465
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,650
John Wick.

466
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:00,641
The man.

467
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,165
The myth.

468
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,686
The legend.

469
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,048
You're not very good at retiring.

470
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,804
I'm workin' on it.

471
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:15,442
Mr. Wick doesn't remember,
but we met many years ago,

472
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,329
before my ascension...

473
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,251
When I was just a pawn in the game.

474
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,811
We met and you gave me a gift,

475
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,644
the gift that would make me a king.

476
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:33,443
You don't remember, but there I was,
standing in an alleyway.

477
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,690
I didn't even hear you comin'.

478
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,527
You gave me this.

479
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:48,410
Gift from the Boogeyman.

480
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,926
Perfect for every occasion.

481
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,807
But you also gave me a choice.

482
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,766
Pull my gun,
shoot you in the back, and die,

483
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,047
or keep the pressure on my neck...

484
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:06,727
and live.

485
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,564
And so you see, I survived.

486
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,846
No one sneaks up on me anymore,
thanks to you.

487
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:20,522
I am all-seeing and all-knowing.

488
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,642
Then you know why I'm here.

489
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:29,726
Santino D'Antonio, yes.

490
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:32,406
Your contract went wide, John.

491
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,369
That's bad for your health.

492
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,203
What's the number up to now, Earl?

493
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,727
Seven million dollars!

494
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,801
Damn!

495
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,004
It's Christmas.
We're going to Applebee's after this.

496
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,927
I need your help.

497
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,766
You have eyes begging for change
on every corner in the city.

498
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:59,047
I'm thinkin' you can find Santino.

499
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:03,130
I need you to move me. Underground.

500
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,486
Get me to him.

501
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,006
How sweet it is!

502
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,571
The Boogeyman begging me for help.

503
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,489
Well, of course, John.

504
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,171
Yes, John. Whatever you'd like, John.

505
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:19,005
Would you like a back rub with that, John?

506
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,730
You're going to help me.

507
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,207
Why the fuck would I do that?

508
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:29,400
Because I'm the only one
that can help you.

509
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,411
You're gonna help me out?

510
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,364
That's downright upright of you, Mr. Wick.

511
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,165
You sound positively magnanimous.

512
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,524
But look around you.

513
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:04,082
How much help does it look like I need?

514
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,043
It seems to me that the real question,
Mr. Wick,

515
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:21,330
is who in this cruel world of ours...
is going to help you?

516
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,361
There's a storm coming.

517
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:41,081
Not just for me. For all of us.

518
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:43,731
For everyone under the Table.

519
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,521
Yes, killing someone who has a seat
at the High Table does create a problem.

520
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,443
But it's your problem, baby.

521
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:55,050
After all, none of my people
sent Gianna D'Antonio...

522
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,764
to the hereafter.

523
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:02,171
That being said, Santino has her seat now.

524
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,446
And he wants the city.

525
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,523
When he's done uptown,
you think he's gonna stop at 14th Street?

526
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,524
We'll just have to take care of ourselves.

527
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:13,806
Oh, yeah?

528
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:16,281
For how long?

529
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,691
And how much blood?

530
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,409
You kill Santino,

531
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,006
the Camorra,
and the High Table come for you.

532
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:27,608
I kill Santino, they come for me.

533
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,645
He's offered $7 million for your life.

534
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:36,964
Seven million dollars
is a lot of money, Mr. Wick.

535
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:45,128
So I guess you have a choice.

536
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:47,929
You want a war?

537
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,321
Or do you wanna just give me a gun?

538
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:05,882
Somebody, please! Get this man a gun!

539
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:15,444
Kimber 1911, .45 ACP.

540
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,525
Seven-round capacity.

541
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,126
Seven rounds?

542
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,806
Seven million dollars
gets you seven rounds.

543
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,368
That's a million dollars a round, baby.

544
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,081
Let's go.

545
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,411
Your descent into Hell begins here,
Mr. Wick.

546
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:56,720
He's at the museum.

547
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,450
Earl will guide you.

548
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,761
Do be careful on your way down.

549
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:05,801
Oh, and remember... you owe me.

550
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,289
You don't want me owing you.

551
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,646
Welcome, everyone.

552
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:43,883
Let us toast to the future
of the High Table

553
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:47,123
and of course,
to the memory of my dear sister.

554
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,089
Nice to see you.

555
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,650
Mr. Akoni, how are you?

556
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:16,089
Wick is here.

557
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,161
Yeah.

558
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:11,241
You and you, with me. You, go.

559
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:29,365
<i>Welcome to
"Reflections of the Soul"</i>

560
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,727
<i>at the New Modern NYC.</i>

561
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:34,884
<i>Within this exhibition,</i>

562
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:38,203
<i>the interplay of light
and the nature of self-images</i>

563
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:40,248
<i>coalesce to provide an experience</i>

564
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,482
<i>which will highlight the fragility</i>

565
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:46,531
<i>of our perception of space
and our place within it.</i>

566
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:49,843
<i>We hope through this exhibit
we can provide new insights</i>

567
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,968
<i>into your understanding of the world,</i>

568
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:55,567
<i>and just possibly lead you
to deeper reflection</i>

569
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:57,244
<i>into the nature of self.</i>

570
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:15,170
The marker is complete, John.

571
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:16,844
You should have just run away.

572
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,647
You know what the Camorra will do to you.

573
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,203
You think you're Old Testament?

574
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,611
No, John.

575
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:38,961
No.

576
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,409
Killing me won't stop the contract.

577
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:48,966
Killing me will make it so much worse.

578
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,121
John...

579
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,726
you know what I think?

580
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:00,727
I think you are addicted to it.

581
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:01,801
To the vengeance.

582
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:22,531
<i>Welcome to
"Reflections of the Soul"</i>

583
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:25,490
<i>at the New Modern NYC.</i>

584
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:29,480
No wife.

585
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,491
No life.

586
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:35,761
No home.

587
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:40,681
Vengeance... it's all you have.

588
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:44,521
You wanted me back.

589
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:46,607
I'm back.

590
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:46,168
<i>You are now exiting
"Reflections of the Soul"</i>

591
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:47,730
<i>at the New Modern NYC.</i>

592
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:50,927
<i>We hope that your journey
through the exhibit</i>

593
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:53,771
<i>has been one of reflective contemplation</i>

594
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,366
<i>allowing for a new perspective
and insight.</i>

595
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:04,443
<i>You are now exiting

596
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:27,408
<i>You are now exiting
"Reflections of the Soul..."</i>

597
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:41,930
Good evening.

598
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,404
Is the manager in?

599
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:48,848
The manager is always in.

600
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:54,961
Winston.

601
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:57,801
Mr. D'Antonio.

602
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,809
Your evening has been colorful, I see.

603
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,962
Seeking safe harbor, I presume?

604
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,567
I want his membership revoked. Now.

605
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:12,009
In the eyes of this institution,
Mr. Wick has breached no legalities.

606
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,208
Then you know that I have the right
to demand...

607
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:18,524
Nothing.
You demand nothing of me, Mr. D'Antonio.

608
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:21,331
This kingdom is mine and mine alone.

609
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,044
All right.

610
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:28,964
Then enjoy your kingdom, Winston,
while you still can.

611
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:32,726
And you, its privileges, sir.

612
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:48,211
I'm here to see Santino D'Antonio.

613
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,527
He's waiting for you in the lounge, sir.

614
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,121
Duck fat.

615
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:48,770
Makes all the difference.

616
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,250
Jonathan...

617
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:52,446
Have you seen the menu here?

618
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:56,407
- Lot of options.
- Jonathan, listen to me...

619
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:59,927
A man can stay here a long time

620
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,690
and never eat the same meal twice.

621
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:06,048
Jonathan, just walk away.

622
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:09,321
Yeah, Jonathan.

623
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:10,925
Walk a...

624
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:20,849
What have you done?

625
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:25,881
Finished it.

626
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:46,169
How was he?

627
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:49,130
He was a good dog.
I have enjoyed his company.

628
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:56,169
Let's go home.

629
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:33,891
Mr. Wick?

630
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:42,522
If you would be so inclined.

631
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:17,841
Come on, boy.

632
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:29,041
It has been a pleasure, Mr. Wick.

633
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:37,371
Good bye.

634
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:15,965
Jonathan.

635
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:17,201
Winston.

636
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,166
What am I lookin' at?

637
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:24,966
The Camorra's doubled
Santino's open contract.

638
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,246
It's gone international.

639
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:28,766
High Table?

640
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:29,841
Mmm-hmm.

641
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,521
And the Continental?

642
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,528
You killed a man on company grounds,
Jonathan.

643
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:40,400
You leave me no choice
but to declare you <i>excommunicado.</i>

644
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:46,291
The doors to any service or provider
in connection with the Continental

645
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:48,806
are now closed to you.

646
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:54,202
I am so sorry.

647
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,242
Your life is now forfeit.

648
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,808
Then why am I not dead?

649
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:06,487
Because I deemed it not to be.

650
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:10,481
Now.

651
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:41,489
You have one hour.
I can't delay it any longer.

652
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:44,765
You might need this...

653
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:47,761
down the road.

654
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:53,401
Winston...

655
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,331
tell them.

656
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:59,482
Tell them all.

657
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:01,562
Whoever comes,

658
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:02,971
whoever it is...

659
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,491
I'll kill them.

660
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:08,130
I'll kill them all.

661
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:13,371
'Course you will.

662
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,171
Jonathan.

663
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,491
Winston.

664
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:46,691
Accounts payable.

665
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:53,365
One-one-one-one-one.

666
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:57,203
In one hour.

667
01:52:58,200 --> 01:52:59,361
John Wick.

668
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:02,929
<i>Excommunicado.</i>

669
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:29,962
Order 11111 confirmed.
